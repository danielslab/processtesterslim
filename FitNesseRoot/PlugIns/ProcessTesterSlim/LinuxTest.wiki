| script | process tester slim |
|attachShutDownHook|

!4 run a short command and wait that it terminates but max 10 second (default)
| script | process tester slim |
| $dir= | executeL; | [sh, -c, /bin/ls -l / !-|-! sort] | 
| start | $dir |
| check | exit value | 0 |
| check not | std err | =~/./ |
| show collapsed | std out |
| check | std out | =~/root/ |

!4 run a long command and wait that it terminates but max 0.5 second
!5 the command will get killed
| script | process tester slim |
| $dir= | executeL; | [sh, -c, for i in {0..9}; do  echo  "$i " ; echo "err $i" 1>&2; sleep 0.1s ; done] | 0.5|
| start | $dir |
| check | exit value | KILL |
| $killStr= | exit value  |
| check | std err | =~/err 1/ |
| show | std out |
|check not | std out | =~/$killStr/|

!4 start multiple programs and let them run in the background 
| script | process tester slim |
| $notepad= | do spawn; | sleep 4m |
| $notepad2= | do spawn; | sleep 1m |
| $p2= | do spawnL; | [sh, -c, for i in {0..9}; do  echo  "$i " ; sleep 0.1s ; done] |
| $p3= | do spawnL; | [sh, -c, for i in {0..9}; do  echo  "$i " ; sleep 0.1s ; done] |
| $tasklist= | do spawnL; | [sh, -c, ps f]|

| script | $notepad |
| terminate |
| check | exit value | KILL |
| show  collapsed| std out |
| show  collapsed| std err |

!4 Check that the kill command works and output can be read
| script | $p2 |
| $first= | std out |
|# Wait only for 0.3  seconds|
| waitFor | 0.3| seconds|
| check | exit value | RUNNING |
| terminate |
| check | exit value | KILL |
| check not | std err | =~/./ |
| show  collapsed| std out |
|# check more output has been added since the first time|
| check not | std out | $first |
| $terminatedOutput= | std out |

!4 Check that "wait for termination" works and output can be read
| script | $p3 |
| check | exit value | RUNNING|
| wait For Termination |
| check | exit value | 0 |
| check not | std err | =~/./ |
| show  collapsed| std out |
|# the output from a killed process should not be the sames as from a terminated one|
| check not | std out | $terminatedOutput |

| script | $tasklist |
| terminate |
| check | exit value | 0 |
| check not | std err | =~/./ |
| show | std out |
